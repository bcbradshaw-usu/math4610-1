{\bf Coding Example for Math 4610 at USU: Creation of a sub-directory.} 
\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in
\noindent
First start up a terminal to do the work to create a file with code in it. For
Cygwin, double click on the Cygwin Icon on your desktop or click on the the
icon in the task bar.

A terminal as shown below will appear. Type in the command shown to create a
new subfolder in the current directory. In the window, the command that does
the work is:
\begin{verbatim}

    mkdir src

\end{verbatim}

{\bf Coding Example for Math 4610 at USU: Change Directory and Edit} 
\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in
\noindent
To change the directory, use the command
\begin{verbatim}

    cd src

\end{verbatim}
Once in the new directory, the next step is to edit a file to implement some
sort of action for the computer. So, type:
\begin{verbatim}

    vim hello.c

\end{verbatim}
The editor, \lq\lq vim\rq\rq\ is a very standard editor and comes with the
installation of Cygwin.

{\bf Coding Example for Math 4610 at USU: Typing in a Program in C} 
\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in
\noindent
The lines in the terminal shown below define a C program for doing a very simple
task. Namely, to print the string

\begin{verbatim}

hello world!

\end{verbatim}
to the screen.

\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in
\noindent
To exit the vim session and save the file, type in a colon character
\lq\lq :\rq\rq\ followed by x and return. The terminal will revert to a command
terminal ready to type in commands.

{\bf Coding Example for Math 4610 at USU: Compiling the Code} 
\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in
\noindent
At the command prompt, the first two lines will be as they were to start. The
next line is used to compile the code. That is,
\begin{verbatim}

    gcc -o hello hello.c

\end{verbatim}
will compile the program and create an executable file for you. The last part
below is used to see what is in the directory. The executable file is
\begin{verbatim}

    hello.exe

\end{verbatim}

{\bf Coding Example for Math 4610 at USU: Final Step - Run the Code} 
\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in
\noindent
Once we have an executable file, hello.exe, the code can be run as follows.
\begin{verbatim}

    ./hello.exe

\end{verbatim}
The output from this command will be as shown in the image below. The output is
printed on the first line.
