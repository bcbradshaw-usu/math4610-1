\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in
\noindent
Once you log in, you will need to build a repository for use in the class and
to turn in homework and completed tasks and projects. For the course, you will
create a repository named the following:
\begin{verbatim}

    math4610

\end{verbatim}
Use only the characters above and using the following rules:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Use only lower case characters - github is case senesitive.
  \item Do not put any blanks in the name of the repository.
\end{enumerate}
Note that the instructor will use only this repository name in looking for your
work.

If you have an account on GitHub, you will already know a lot about these
things. However, when you are logged in you will see the main screen with any
repositories you may already have created. We will go through the steps to
build and name repositories in the next few pages.
