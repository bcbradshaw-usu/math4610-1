{\bf Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics  - Topic 7.}
\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in \noindent
We will need to communicate through Github for most of the semester. Github is
a site where you can store/share all kinds of computational data, programs, and
documents. So, in this topic we will go through the process of setting up an
account, if you do not already have and account, and set up a repository for the
course. Once this is done, we will work with folders and subfolders where you
will be able to complete homework and other assignments. More importantly, 
learning how to create a repository is important.

{\bf Get an Account on Github} 
\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in\noindent
To create an account on GitHub, go to the Github site on any browser. If you
already have an account, you can skip this step.
\begin{verbatim}

    https://github.com

\end{verbatim}
This site will display a place to create an account or sign in to an existin
account. If you have an account, sign in. If not, work through creating an
account. Accounts for students are free on Github. For instructors and faculty
the fee is more than reasonable.

{\bf Signing into Github If You have an Account} 
\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in\noindent
If you already have an account or have created an account and logged off you
will need to be signed in. A screenshot of the Sign In page is shown below.

{\bf Navigating the Github Home Page} 
\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in\noindent
Once you log in, you will see a home page that looks like that in the figure.
\begin{verbatim}

    math4610

\end{verbatim}
Use only the 8 characters above and using the following rules:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Use only lower case characters - github is case senesitive.
  \item Do not put any blanks or other characters in the name of the repository.
\end{enumerate}
Note that the instructor will use only this repository name in looking for your
homework and other assignments. The next topic will cover the git
interface/platform to transfer homework assignments to and from your
repositories. So, it is imperative that the course repository is given the name
above.

If you have an account on GitHub, you will already know a lot about these
things. However, when you are logged in you will see the main screen with any
repositories you may already have created. We will go through the steps to
build and name repositories in the next few pages.
