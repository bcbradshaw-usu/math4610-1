        Floating Point Representation of Numbers.

    The term double precision refers to a 64 bit format with the bits
    distributed as follows.
    <ul>
      <li> bits 0 through 51 (52 bits) define the mantissa or fraction </li>
      <li> bits 52 through 62 (11 bits) define the integer exponent </li>
      <li> bit 63 (1 bit) for the sign of the number </li>
    </ul>
    Mostly, codes will run in double precision and most new operating systems or
    updates of older operating systems work in 64-bit arithmetic. This is an
    indication that the old version of double precision is more like the current
    single precision.

    There are a couple of cautionary remarks that should be made at this point
    of the presentation. First, not all compilers (especially C/C++) treat
    the float type as single precision. In fact, you should always test your
    compiler to make sure that single precision and double precision mean what
    you think they mean. The second not is that there can be challenges when an
    entire operating system moves from one precision to a precision with more
    resolution. When IBM moved from 16-bit arithmetic to 32-bit arithmetic a
    bug in the operating system could be manipulated to give erroneous results
    in simple computations. In the late 1980's, Sun Microsystems Inc. introduced
    128-bit operating systems for scientific computing. So, it is a very good
    idea to understand the resolution.
