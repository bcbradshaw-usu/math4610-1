    Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics:
        Floating Point Representation of Numbers.
  </h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Any work that is done on a computer boils down to manipulating numbers. A
    problem with this is that computers have finite resources and the
    representation of many numbers requires the use of an infinite number of
    decimal digits. For example, given a circle, the formula for the
    circumference is
    $$C = 2 \times \pi \times r = \pi \times d$$
    where $r$ is the radius of the circle and $d$ is the diameter of the circle.
    The number $\pi$ is not a rational number. That is, the decimal expansion of
    this value has an infinite fractional part. The value can be represented as
    follows:
    $$\pi\approx 3.141592653589793...$$
    where the ellipsis notation, $...$, means the digits never repeat. So, to
    get an exact representation of $\pi$ it is necessary to have an infinite
    number of digits available. Since computer resources are finite, we must
    settle for an approximation.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this part of the lecture, we will use a few examples that should
    motivate us to spend some time on this issue and more fully understand the
    implications of finite precision of number representation.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the first example, we could use the approximation
    $$\pi\approx 3.141592653589793$$
    without including an infinite number of digits. One question that should
    arise is how many digits will provide us with an accurate enough
    approximation. One of the programs used over the past few decades to
    \lq\lq\ burn in machines was an algorithm to compute more and more digits of
    $\pi$. This means that is possible to determine $\pi$ to any degree of
    accuracy that we want. However, it is not practical for real problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some cases, a very crude approximation is enough. In some of our United
    States, laws have been passed to legally approximate $\pi$ using a rational
    number. For example,
    $$\pi\approx {{22}\over 7}$$
    provides an approximation that will hold up in a courts of law. If you are
    pouring a circular concrete slab for a water tank it is a good idea to have
    an estimate of the amount of concrete based on an accepted value for the
    number $\pi$.
  </p>
  <p>
    Basically, numbers are best represented on a computer using zeros and ones -
    or in a binary number system. Other common number systems used in computer
    architecture/hardware are in octal (or base 8) and hexadecimal (or base 16).
    Another issue that arises in the representation of numbers is numbers that
    are relatively prime to base 2. As a simple example, consider the
    representation of the number $1/3$ in base 2.  The value is
    $${1\over 3} = 0.01010101.....$$
    where the last pair of digits repeats forever. If a finite number of binary
    digits are used to represent $1/3$, the result is an approximation of the
    exact value. Note that a base 10 representation of $1/3$ is given by the
    decimal representation
    $${1\over 3} = 0.3333333333333.........$$
    Even if computers worked in a base 10 system, we would necessarily have to
    settle for approximate number representation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since there are an uncountable number of irrational numbers, it is
    impossible to imagine a computer that would not suffer the same issue. So,
    the best we can hope for is that there is an accepted number representation
    that will work on all computers. There is a standard (IEEE standard
    reference here) for number representation that we will look into later in
    the course. For now, we will assume that all of the computers we will use
    will behave the same way. From a practical point of view, it would be nice
    to be able to compute the limits of the accuracy of machine numbers.
    Fortunately, we can write a little program that will do the trick for us.
