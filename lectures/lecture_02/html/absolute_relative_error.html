    Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics: Measurement of Error

  <h3>
    Absolute and Relative Error: Introduction.} 
  </h3>
  <p>
    In most cases, the solution of a mathematical problem can only be
    approximated. So, it would be a good idea to have a way to measure the error
    between the exact solution and the approximation of that solution. We will
    define two types of error. These are absolute error and relative error. The
    <bold> absolute error </bold> is the absolute value of the difference
    between the approximation and the exact value for the solution. That is, if
    $x^*$ is the exact value approximated by $x$, then
    $$ e_{abs} = | x - x^{*} | $$
    defines the absolute error. The <bold> relative error </bold> is a scaled
    error defined by
    $$ e_{rel} = {{| x - x^{*} |}\over{|x^*|}} $$
    So, the relative error is a scaled or percent error based on the magnitude
    of the exact value.

    Absolute and Relative Error: Examples. 
  </h3>
  <hr>
  <p>
    If we are trying to find the roots of the polynomial
    $$p(x) = x^5 + x^3 - 2\ x^2 + 5\ x$$
    we can see that $x=0$ is one solution. To find other roots we can use
    Newton's method to generate a sequence of approximations given a starting
    point. That is, we will generate a sequence
    $$ S = \left\lbrace x_k \right\rbrace_{k=0}^{\infty} $$
    Newton's method will be covered a bit later in this course. However, what we
    will want is for the sequence to converge to a root, say $x^*$. This can be
    rephrased as
    $$ | x_k - x^* | \rightarrow 0 $$
    which implies the absolute error will tend to zero as $k$ tends to $\infty$.
    Using the relative error we want
    $$ {{ | x_k - x^* | }\over{ | x^* | }} \rightarrow 0 $$
    For the polynomial define in this example, there will be problems in using
    the relative error near the zero roots. So, if the sequence starts to
    converg to the zero root, we would need to use the absolute error as a
    measure.

  <h3>
    Absolute and Relative Error: A Numerical Example.
  </h3>
  <p>
    As an illustration of how absolute and relative errors compare, we can
    consider some numerical examples. The following table gives a pair of
    numbers along with both the absolute and relative errors.
    $$
    \begin{table}[h!]
      \caption{Absolute and Relative Error Values}
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
     \hline
     \textbf{$x$} & \textbf{$x^*$} & \textbf{abs. err.} & \textbf{rel. err.} \\
     \hline
     0.01 & 0.1 & 0.09 & 0.9 \\
     \hline
     1.01 & 1.0 & 0.01 & 0.01 \\
     \hline
     2.0   & 3.0  & 1.0 & 0.5 \\
     \hline
     10.0  & 9.0  & 1.0 & 0.1 \\
     \hline
     100.0 & 99.0 & 1.0 & 0.01 \\
     \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \end{table}
    $$
    Note that when both the approximation and exact value are close to zero, the
    absolute error becomes a better measure of error than the relative error and
    for large values (at least greater than one) one should expect that the
    better measure of the error is the relative error. We will use both in the
    development of algorithms to numerically solve mathematical problems.
