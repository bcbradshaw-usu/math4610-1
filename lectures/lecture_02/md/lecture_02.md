# Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics  - Lecture 2

In this lesson, you will be introduced to a simple algorithm for the
determination of a machine epsilon. This algorithm will motivate an organized
presentation of round off error and the analysis of how errors accumulate in
complicated computations. One way to proceed is through interval analysis
applied to numbers that are approximated in machine arithmetic. A simple 
example of how to build a shared library will also be discussed. This is an
important skill to have in computational mathematics.

## Content Items:

  1. **Homework repositories on Github:** - We will discuss the homework
     repository that each of you will create. The homework repository should be
     a private repository with you instructor as the only collaborator. Homework
     will be graded by first cloning the repository and then creating a pull
     action to grade any modifications.

  2. **Using Version Control Systems (VCS) - git:** A brief discussion of "git"
       will be taken up in class to show how to work and collaborate with other
       students and your instructor. The "git" platform allows you to work on a
       laptop at home and then "push" your work and any modifications to Github
       where the instructor can get to the work.

  2. **An Algorithm for Machine Precision:** A simple algorithm for determining
       the precision for number representation will be covered. Two different
       versions of the code will be presented that determine single and double
       precision for your computer.

  3. **Writing a Code with Different Precision:** 

  4. **Including Code in Shared Libraries:** 

  5. **Definitions of Floating Point Numbers:** 

  6. **An Introduction to Interval Analysis:** 

  7. **Wrap up and Questions:** If there is time and anyone has questions about
       the lecture, these will be addressed.
