# Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics  - Lecture 2

In this lesson, you will be introduced to a simple algorithm for the
determination of a machine epsilon. This algorithm will motivate an organized
presentation of round off error and the analysis of how errors accumulate in
complicated computations. One way to proceed is through interval analysis
applied to numbers that are approximated in machine arithmetic. A simple 
example of how to build a shared library will also be discussed. This is an
important skill to have in computational mathematics.
