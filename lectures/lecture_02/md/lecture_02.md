# Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics  - Lecture 2

In this lesson, you will be introduced to a simple algorithm for the
determination of a machine epsilon. This algorithm will motivate an organized
presentation of round off error and the analysis of how errors accumulate in
complicated computations. One way to proceed is through interval analysis
applied to numbers that are approximated in machine arithmetic. A simple 
example of how to build a shared library will also be discussed. This is an
important skill to have in computational mathematics.

## Content Items:

  1. **Homework repositories on Github:** - We will discuss the homework
     repository that each of you will create. The homework repository should be
     a private repository with you instructor as the only collaborator. Homework
     will be graded by first cloning the repository and then creating a pull
     action to grade any modifications.

  2. **Using Version Control Systems (VCS) - git:** A brief discussion of "git"
       will be taken up in class to show how to work and collaborate with other
       students and your instructor. The "git" platform allows you to work on a
       laptop at home and then "push" your work and any modifications to Github
       where the instructor can get to the work.

  2. **An Algorithm for Machine Precision:** A simple algorithm for determining
       the precision for number representation will be covered. Two different
       versions of the code will be presented that determine single and double
       precision for your computer.

  3. **Writing a Code with Different Precision:** 

  4. **Including Code in Shared Libraries:** 

  5. **Definitions of Floating Point Numbers:** 

  6. **An Introduction to Interval Analysis:** 

  7. **Wrap up and Questions:** If there is time and anyone has questions about
       the lecture, these will be addressed.

# Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics  - Lecture 1

---

The content for each lecture in Math 4610 will be presented in a lecture format
that will follow an outline presented at the beginning of each class period.
For the first lecture, the following list of items will be covered:

---

  2. **A Brief Introduction to Command Windows and Linux/Unix:** To be
       effective in Math 4610 you will need to be able to work in some command
       window environment. Many of the software applications we will use will
       require Linux/Unix emulation at a minimum. You are encouraged to install
       Cygwin on your computer if you have enough space. If you are running
       on a Linux machine there is no need to download and install Cygwin.
       Also, if you are using a Mac, the desktop system is already built on a
       Unix kernel. So, there are ready made ways to interact with Unix on a
       Mac/Appled. One such example is Homebrew.

  3. **Compiling and Running a Simple Code - Hello World:** As a simple
       example, how to compile and run a simple code in the C programming
       language will be presented. This will be related to the command window
       primer in the lecture.

  4. **Github and Homework:** You will need to create a student account on
       Github for this course. You will be required to build and maintain a
       software manual for the computer codes you will write. A specific format
       for your homework repository and the software manual will be discussed.

  5. **Wrap up and Questions:** If there is time and anyone has questions about
       the lecture, these will be addressed.
