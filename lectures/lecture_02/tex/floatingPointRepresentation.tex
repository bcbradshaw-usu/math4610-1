    Representation of Numbers.}

Any work that is done on a computer boils down to manipulating numbers. A
problem with this is that computers have finite resources and the representation
of many numbers requires the use of an infinite number of decimal digits. For
example, given a circle, the formula for the circumference is
$$C = 2 \times \pi \times r = \pi \times d$$
where $r$ is the radius of the circle and $d$ is the diameter of the circle. The
number $\pi$ is not a rational number. That is, the decimal expansion of this
value has an infinite fractional part. The value can be represented as follows:
$$\pi\approx 3.141592653589793...$$
where the ellipsis notation, $...$, means the digits never repeat. So, to get an
exact representation of $\pi$ it is necessary to have an infinite number of
digits available. Since compouter resources are finite, we must settle for an
approximation.

We could use the approximation
$$\pi\approx 3.141592653589793$$
without including an infinite number of digits. One question the should arise is
how many digits will provide us with an accurate enough approximation.  In some
cases, a very crude approximation is enough. In some of our United States, laws
have been passed to legally approximate $\pi$ using a rational number. For
example,
$$\pi\approx {{22}\over 7}$$
provides an approximation that will hold up in a courst of law. If you are
pouring a circular concrete slab for a water tank it is a good idea to have a
concrete estimate for the number $\pi$.

Basically, numbers are best represented on a computer using zeros and ones -
or in a binary number system. Other common number systems used involve octal
or base 8 and hexidecimal or base 16. Another issue that arises in the
representation of numbers is numbers that are relatively prime to base 2. As
a simple example, consider the representation of the number $1/3$ in base 2.
The value is
$${1\over 3} = 0.01010101.....$$
where the last pair of digits repeats forever. If a finite number of binary
digits are used to represent $1/3$, the result is an approximation of the exact
value. Note that a base 10 representation of $1/3$ is given by the decimal
representation
$${1\over 3} = 0.3333333333333.........$$
Even if computers worked in a base 10 system, we would necessarily have to
settle for approximate number representation.
