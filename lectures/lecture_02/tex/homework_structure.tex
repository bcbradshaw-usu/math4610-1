{\bf Homework Repository for Math 4610: Creating a Table of Contents .} 
\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in
\noindent
The first task students will need to address is how to organize the homework
solutions that are turned in. The homework will come in the form of task sheets
and upon completion of the tasks, students will need to turn in their work. It
will be required that there is a table of contents for the homework solutions
and a structure that organizes the different solution sets. The steps that
students will need to perform are the following.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Create a table of contents file called hw\_toc.md. The form and contents
        of the file will be treated in class. At least you will have a couple of
        entries by the time we are through.
  \item Modify the name of the file to create a folder/directory to store
        solutions to the homework.
  \item In addition, in this part of the lecture, a subfolder for each solution
        set will be determined.
\end{enumerate}
Note that Github will not allow you the luxury of creating an empty folder. This
is an advantage in using \lq\lq git\rq\rq\ on a local machine. When changes are
\lq\lq pushed\rq\rq\ to Github, empty folders are ignored. So, let's get started
on the formatting.

{\bf Homework Repository for Math 4610: Get to Github.} 
\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in
The first step is to login to your Github account. So, in a web browser, type in
\begin{verbatim}

    https://github.com/

\end{verbatim}
and log on to your account. By this point you should already have an account on
Github.

Once the following pops up, we can navigate in amongst the repositories if you
have more than one. In any case, you should have a repository named
\begin{verbatim}

    math4610

\end{verbatim}
Click on this repository to start creating files and the like. Click on the
button that will create a new file.
