**GitHub Primer for Math 4610 at USU:** Setting up a Repository} 

<hr>

Once you log in, you will need to build a repository for use in the class and
to turn in homework and completed tasks and projects. For the course, you will
create a repository named the following:

     math4610

Use only the characters above and using the following rules:

  * Use only lower case characters - github is case senesitive.

  * Do not put any blanks in the name of the repository.

Note that the instructor will use only this repository name in looking for your
work.

**Github Primer for Math 4610 at USU:** List the Contents of the Home Directory 

<hr>

If you have an account on GitHub, you will already know a lot about these
things. However, when you are logged in you will see the main screen with any
repositories you may already have created. We will go through the steps to
build and name repositories in the next few pages.
