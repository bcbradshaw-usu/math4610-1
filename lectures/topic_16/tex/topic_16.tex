{\bf Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics  - Topic 16.}
\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in \noindent
In this section we will present a couple of examples of Markdown and HTML for
displaying web content. We will start with an example of a web page written in
the two different mark up languages, one in HTML and one in Markdown to compare
how Markdown and HTML choose to format items on a web page. We will also work
through the page source in each case to compare the effort needed to format
pages in these two web development languages.

In a second example, we will consider the use of MathJax to display mathematical
formulas. Being a quick and slick markup language, Markdown does not play well
with Javascript or similar scripting languages. There are always ways around 
these problems. However, if standardization is important it is important to keep
things simple.

{\bf The Documents For This Course:}
\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in \noindent
Most of the notes in this course can be separated into one of three types of
files. These are (1) Portable Document Format (pdf), (2) Hypertext Markup
Language (html), and (3) Markdown (md) files. Each of these formatting languages
has speccific advantages over the others. pdf files are ubiquitus in working
with computers. There are many billions of documents on the internet that are
pdf documents. It would be surprising if any student registering for a computer
course has not dealy with pdf files. Anyone using the internet for any purpose
is using html files by the hundreds if not thousands per hour. md files are a
recent streamlined display language. If should be noted that most html tags can
be used within individual md files.

Most documents on the repositry for the course have been developed in one, two,
or all three of the formats. There are some text files for code, but the vast
majority of documents are of thre three types mentioned. One last note is that
all browsers give the users access to the page source. Viewing the source of a 
particular page is common. It is relatively easy to see what things others have
done and use or improve formatting using pages as examples. Right clicking on a
Firefox and other browser page will produce a menu of items that include a
\lq\lq View Page Source\rq\rq\ choice. When you click on this choice the actual
code/source is displayed.
