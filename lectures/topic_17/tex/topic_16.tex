In this section we will present a couple of examples of Markdown and HTML for
displaying web content. We will start with an example of two web pages, one in
HTML and one in Markdown to compare how Markdown and HTML choose to format items
on a web page. We will also work through the page source in each case to compare
the effort needed to format pages in these two web development languages.

In a second example, we will consider the use of MathJax to display mathematical
formulas....
