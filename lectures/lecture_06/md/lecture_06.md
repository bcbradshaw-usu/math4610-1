# Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics  - Lecture 6

The development and analysis of functional iteration for computing approximate
solution of the root finding problem is presented. Functional iteration or fixed
point iteration requires the development of an associated fixed point equation
followed by the definition of an algorithm that produces a (possibly infinite)
sequance of approximation given an initial guess at the solution. An analysis of
the basic algorithm is presented using Taylor series expansions around an
exact solution.

  1. **The General Root Finding Problem:** Many mathematical problems boil down
     to finding values where a function is zero. A simple, but general statement
     of the problem will be presented along with examples.

  2. **Documentation of Reusable Code:**  Each student will need to write a
     software manual for the algorithms implemented in class. A template for the
     software manual has been created by your instructor using Jekyll on Github.
     Students are required to use the template and can look at the template and
     download a copy of the template for their own use.

  3. **Link to the Software Manual Template** The link for the software
     maual is:

  4. **Wrap up and Questions:**  If there is time and anyone has questions about
     the lecture, these will be addressed.
