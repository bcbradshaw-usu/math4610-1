# Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics  - Lecture 4

In this and the next lecture or two algorithms for computing the solution of
the general root finding problem will be covered. In this lecture, functional
iteration will be discussed including the idea of convergence and

  1. **Building a Shared Library for Reusing Code:** (cont) An important skill
     that computational mathematicians should learn is to take relatively small
     codes and turn these into reusable object files. These can be collected
     into a shared library. A shared library can be linked to by other programs
     from this point on. Note that the equivalent of a shared library in a
     Windows setting is called a DLL.

  2. **Documentation of Reusable Code:**  Each student will need to write a
     software manual for the algorithms implemented in class. A template for the
     software manual has been created by your instructor using Jekyll on Github.
     Students are required to use the template and can look at the template and
     download a copy of the template for their own use.

  3. **Wrap up and Questions:**  If there is time and anyone has questions about
     the lecture, these will be addressed.
