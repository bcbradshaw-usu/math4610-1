    Introduction to the Course
  </h2>
  <hr>
  <p>
    This course presents fundamental content from numerical methods/analysis and
    and introductory computational skills. Methods and some analysis of the
    methods will be presented in the lectures. The content for each lecture in
    Math 4610 will be presented as a subset from a
    <a href="../../toc/md/topic_toc.md"> list of topics </a>. The topics
    will be covered in order as a continuous stream of material until the end of
    the semester. So, we may cover one or two topics during a single lecture or
    we may take multiple lectures to cover a single topic.
  </p>
  <p>
    The course will not cover a long and thorough list of topics from
    computational mathematics. Instead of covering a long list of numerical
    methods, we will weave in computational skills like parallel programming,
    data visualization, and a few topics that are not ordinarily covered in a
    numerical analysis or numerical methods course.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next step by going over a syllabus for the course.
