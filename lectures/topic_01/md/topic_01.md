# Topic 1: Math 4610 Fundamentals of Numerical Analysis 

<hr>

## Introduction to the Course

<hr>

This course presents fundamental content from numerical methods/analysis and
introductory computational skills concepts. Numerical methods and some analysis
of the numerical methods will be presented in the lectures. The content for each
lecture will be presented from a [list of topics](../../toc/md/topic_toc.md)
that bounces around between advanced computational skills, numerical methods,
and some mathematics to prove basic results. The topics will be covered in order
as a continuous stream of material until the end of the semester. So, we may
cover one or two topics during a single lecture or we may take multiple lectures
to cover a single topic.

The course will not cover a long and thorough list of topics from computational
mathematics. Instead of covering a long list of numerical methods, we will weave
in computational skills like parallel programming, data visualization, and a few
topics that are not ordinarily covered in a numerical analysis or numerical
methods course.

The next step by going over a syllabus for the course.
