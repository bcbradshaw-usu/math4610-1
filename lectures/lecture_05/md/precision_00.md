As a way to make sure that finite precision numbers and the arithmetic
operations used to work with these numbers produce correct results we need a
consistent/accepted format for numbers used on any/all computers. It is typical
to define numbers in a fixed format that can be manipulated in predictable ways.
A standard way to classify the storage of numbers is in terms of whether the
number representation is of single or double precision. Single precision is a
number format that occupies 32 bits and double precision is a number format that
typically uses 64 bits. Note that the use of these formats also dictates memory
limitations in terms of the total amount of memory and disk space available to
actually do work.
