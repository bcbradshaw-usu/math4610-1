# Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics  - Lecture 5

In this lecture we will take up one topic in how to work within the "git"
framework and more on roundoff error, problems that arise in using arithmetic
operations on machine numbers, and methods that can be used to modify algorithms
and code to mitigate some of these problems. That is, we will talk about how to
control the accumulation of roundoff errors for those sources of error that can
be addressed by computational scientists.

## Content Items:

  1. **Using Version Control Systems (VCS) - git:** A brief discussion of "git"
       will be taken up in class to show how to work and collaborate with other
       students and your instructor. The "git" platform allows you to work on a
       laptop at home and then "push" your work and any modifications to Github
       where the instructor can get to the work.

  2. **Statement of the Root Finding Problem:**  Many applied mathematics
     problems can be stated in the form of a general root finding problem. In
     this lecture the general root finding problem will be stated. Algorithms
     for the root finding problem will be presented in the next few lectures.

  3. **Wrap up and Questions:**  If there is time and anyone has questions about
     the lecture, these will be addressed.
