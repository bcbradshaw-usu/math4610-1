{\bf Math 4610 Table of Contents for Lectures by Topic:}
\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in
\noindent
The topics listed below form the content for lectues in the class. The course
will start with the first topic and will move through each topic in order. The
idea is to go through as many topics as possible. If a topic is not needed, it
can be skipped or maybe come back during a leter lecture. The topics are
self-contained. There is no set number of topics that can/will be covered in a
single lecture. For example, during the first class it is likely that three or
four topics will be covered based on the instructor and how many questions are
being asked.

The contents will likely change from semester to semester. So, the guide for
this course is the table of contents listed here.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\noindent
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Introductory Comments: This course presents fundamental content from
        numerical methods/analysis....
  \item The Syllabus for Math 4610 Fundamentals of Numerical Analysis: This
        course presents fundamental topics and algorithms that are common to
        many areas of computational mathematics....
  \item Github Account: You will create a repository with a specific name. The
        name will be 
        \begin{verbatim}
 
          math4610

        \end{verbatim}
  \item Building a Github Repository for Math 4610: You will learn how to build
        a repository on Github that will be used to turn in your homework and
        projects.
  \item Using a Terminal: It will be imperative that you are able to work in a
        terminal. There are a number of applications that can be used to bring
        up a terminal running a Linux/Unix operating system or an emulater. A
        few of these are PowerShell, Cygwin/MinGW terminals, Bash on Windows.
  \item A Few Shell Commands: A brief primer on how to use commands in a
        terminal are necessary.
  \item A coding example in C and Fortran: This example will show you how to use
        a command line terminal to write, compile, and execute a program.
  \item How to Build Shared Libraries: Reuse of code requires a way to store and
        link to the code.
  \item Testing the Library: 
  \item Using git to work locally: Having a repository on Github is great.
        However, to work locally, git, will let you work locally and easily
        transfer files to/from your repositories.
  \item Taylor Series Review: In an initial course in numerical analysis, Taylor
        series are used in the evaluation of accuracy.
  \item Compiling and Executing Computer Programs:
  \item Creating a Shared Library:
  \item Linking to a Shared Library:
  \item An Example of Arithmetic Accuracy - Approximating the Value of a
        Derivative: We will analyze the approximation of a first derivative with
        a finite difference quotient.
  \item Taylor Series Analysis of the Difference Quotient:
  \item Testing the Difference Quotient Example: We will write a code to test
        the difference quotient approximation.
  \item An Introduction to the Root Finding Problem:
  \item The Intermediate Value Theorem for Continuous Functions:
  \item The Bisection Method: A simple application of the Intermediate Value
        Theorem results in a root finding method.
  \item A Recursive Definition for the Bisection Method:
  \item Rewriting the Bisection Method for Efficiency:
  \item Truncation Error: A definition of truncation error is ....
  \item Roundoff Error:
  \item Absolute and Relative Error:
  \item Examples of Roundoff Error in Real Life: Roundoff error can accumulate
        in computationally intensive algorithms.
  \item Solving a linear system using Gaussian Elimination and Roundoff Error:
  \item Truncation Error vs. Roundoff Error in the Finite Difference
        Approximation:
  \item Bounds on Error: Interval Analysis and Accumulation of Roundoff Error:
  \item Stable Algorithms and Computation: related topic involves selecting
       \lq\lq stable\rq\rq algorithms for solution of real problems. Stable
        algorithms are less sensitive to accumulation of errors.
  \item FLOPS:
  \item Efficiency of an Algotihm: Counting the number of computations in the
        execution of an algorithm.
  \item Tradeoffs between Accuracy and Efficiency:
  \item Number of Operations for Bisection:
  \item Newton's Method for Finding Roots:
  \item The Secant Method:
