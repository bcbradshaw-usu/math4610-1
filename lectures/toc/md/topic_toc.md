# Math 4610 Table of Contents for Lectures by Topic:

The following list includes links to the lectures in Math 4610. You can go back
to the [Introduction to Math 4610](../../../README.md) if needed to restart from
the beginning.

  * **Topic 1.** [Introductory Comments:](../../topic_01/md/topic_01.md)

        This course presents fundamental content from numerical methods/analysis
        and introductory computational skills concepts....

  * **Topic 2.** [Syllabus](../../topic_02/pdf/embed_02.md)

        The syllabus for Math 4610 does not include any content, but time will
        be spent on all the details of grading and the work in the course....

  * **Topic 3.** [Github Accounts:](../../topic_03/md/topic_03.md) 

        We will be using git and Github to do almost all of our work. This
        includes setting up a place store and retrieve files, save code,
        assignments, and your software manual....

  * **Topic 4.** [Opening a Terminal:](../../topic_04/md/topic_04.md)

        This topic covers information on how to work with terminals and using a
        Linux or Unix environment. In most real computational settings, it is
        important to be able to work using a command line to create files,
        modify these files, compile code, and a number of other tasks....

  * **Topic 5.** [Linux/Unix Commands:](../../topic_05/md/topic_05.md) 

        This topic covers information on how to work once a terminal is up and
        running on your computer. A Linux/Unix operating system should be
        running in the terminal. In most real computational settings, it is
        important to be able to work using a command line to create files,
        modify these files, compile code, and a number of other tasks....

  * **Topic 6.** [A Simple Programming Example:](../../topic_06/md/topic_06.md)

        This section will give a simple example of writing a code, compiling a
        code, and executing a code in a terminal. First start up a terminal to
        do the work to create a file with code in it. For Cygwin, double click
        on the Cygwin Icon on your desktop or click on the the icon in the task
        bar if the app is pinned to the taskbar....

  * **Topic 7.** [Building a Github Repository:](../../topic_07/md/topic_07.md)

        We will need to communicate through Github for most of the semester.
        Github is a site where you can store/share all kinds of computational
        data, programs, and documents....

  * **Topic 8.** [Using git to Work Locally:](../../topic_08/md/topic_08.md)

        You can chose to work on projects on Github by logging onto the Github
        web site with your username and password. However, if your internet
        connection is not as good as you might like, you can use "git" to
        synchronize the work on your project.

  * **Topic 9.** [An Example: Approximation of the Derivative:](../../topic_09/html/topic_09.html)

        In this section we will see an example of an approximation of a
        derivative that produces errors in the value of the derivative no matter
        what we do with the limit approximation. The difference between the
        exact and approximate value will reduce at first and then will start to
        grow.

{\bf Math 4610 Table of Contents for Lectures by Topic:}
\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in
\noindent
The topics listed below form the content for lectues in the class. The course
will start with the first topic and will move through each topic in order. The
idea is to go through as many topics as possible. If a topic is not needed, it
can be skipped or maybe come back during a leter lecture. The topics are
self-contained. There is no set number of topics that can/will be covered in a
single lecture. For example, during the first class it is likely that three or
four topics will be covered based on the instructor and how many questions are
being asked.

The contents will likely change from semester to semester. So, the guide for
this course is the table of contents listed here.
