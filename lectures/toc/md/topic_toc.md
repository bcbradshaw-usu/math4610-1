# Math 4610 Table of Contents for Lectures by Topic:

The following list includes links to the lectures in Math 4610. You can go back
to the [Introduction to Math 4610](../../../README.md) if needed to restart from
the beginning.

  * **Topic 1.** [Introductory Comments:](../../topic_01/md/topic_01.md)

        This course presents fundamental content from numerical methods/analysis
        and introductory computational skills concepts....

  * **Topic 2.** [Syllabus](../../topic_02/pdf/embed_02.md)

        The syllabus for Math 4610 does not include any content, but time will
        be spent on all the details of grading and the work in the course....

  * **Topic 3.** [Github Accounts:](../../topic_03/md/topic_03.md) 

        We will be using git and Github to do almost all of our work. This
        includes setting up a place store and retrieve files, save code,
        assignments, and your software manual....

  * **Topic 4.** [Opening a Terminal:](../../topic_04/md/topic_04.md)

        This topic covers information on how to work with terminals and using a
        Linux or Unix environment. In most real computational settings, it is
        important to be able to work using a command line to create files,
        modify these files, compile code, and a number of other tasks....

  * **Topic 5.** [Linux/Unix Commands:](../../topic_05/md/topic_05.md) 

        This topic covers information on how to work once a terminal is up and
        running on your computer. A Linux/Unix operating system should be
        running in the terminal. In most real computational settings, it is
        important to be able to work using a command line to create files,
        modify these files, compile code, and a number of other tasks....

  * **Topic 6.** [A Simple Programming Example:](../../topic_06/md/topic_06.md)

        This section will give a simple example of writing a code, compiling a
        code, and executing a code in a terminal. First start up a terminal to
        do the work to create a file with code in it. For Cygwin, double click
        on the Cygwin Icon on your desktop or click on the the icon in the task
        bar if the app is pinned to the taskbar....

  * **Topic 7.** [Building a Github Repository:](../../topic_07/md/topic_07.md)

        We will need to communicate through Github for most of the semester.
        Github is a site where you can store/share all kinds of computational
        data, programs, and documents....

  * **Topic 8.** [Using git to Work Locally:](../../topic_08/md/topic_08.md)

        You can chose to work on projects on Github by logging onto the Github
        web site with your username and password. However, if your internet
        connection is not as good as you might like, you can use "git" to
        synchronize the work on your project.

  * **Topic 9.** [An Example: Approximation of the Derivative:](../../topic_09/html/topic_09.html)

        In this section we will see an example of an approximation of a
        derivative that produces errors in the value of the derivative no matter
        what we do with the limit approximation. The difference between the
        exact and approximate value will reduce at first and then will start to
        grow.

  * **Topic 10.** [2D Graphics Shareware](../../topic_10/html/topic_10.html)

        It is very important as a computational mathematician that we use
        computational resources to visualize data or output from simulations.
        This means producing graphics codes that can display output from
        simulations or visualization of data sets measured in the real world.

  * **Topic 11.** [Reusable Graphics Applications in Python](../../topic_11/html/topic_11.html)

        In the last topic, a means for producing graphs for a single function
        that has been hardwired into the Python module. It would be a lot better
        to have a module or modules that can handle a little more generality in
        the function being graphed.

  * **Topic 12.** [Truncation Error and Taylor Series](../../topic_12/html/topic_12.html)

        Most mathematical problems require the use of approximations as a part
        of the solution process. For example, the solution of the simple
        ordinary differential equation

  * **Topic 13.** [Review of Taylor Series: Some Examples](../../topic_13/html/topic_13.html)

        In the previous section of these topics, a need for Taylor series
        expansions was identified in the evaluation of a natural exponential
        function. In this section of the notes, some examples of Taylor series
        expansions will be computed and/or stated for completeness.

  * **Topic 14.** [Error Analysis of Derivative Approximations:](../../topic_14/html/topic_14.html)

        In this section we will analyze approximation of derivatives using
        various difference quotients. Recall that the derivative of a function
        f(x) exists if the following limit exists.

  * **Topic 15.** [A Brief Introduction to Markdown](../../topic_15/md/topic_15.md)

        In this section a brief introduction to Markdown will be presented.
        Since most of the work we will do in the course will be appear on Github
        and Github likes Markdown as a web page formatting tool it makes some
        sense to be familiar with at least a few basics.

  * **Topic 16.** [Differences Between HTML and Markdown](../../topic_16/md/topic_16.md)

        In this section we will present a couple of examples of Markdown and
        HTML for displaying web content. We will start with an example of two
        web pages, one in HTML and one in Markdown to compare how Markdown and
        HTML choose to format items on a web page.

  * **Topic 17.** [Computational Accuracy: Machine Precision](../../topic_17/html/topic_17.html)
