<h1> Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics  - Topic 13. </h1>

<hr>

In the previous section of these topics, a need for Taylor series expansions
was identified in the evaluation of a natural exponential function. In this
section of the notes, some examples of Taylor series expansions will be computed
and/or stated for completeness. Recall that the definition of the Taylor series
for a function, \(f(x)\) is the following.
\[
  f(x) = f(x_0)
   + {1\over{1!}}\ f'(x_0) ( x - x_0 ) + {1\over{2!}}\ f''(x_0) ( x - x_0 )^2
   + {1\over{3!}}\ f'''(x_0) ( x - x_0 )^3 + \cdots
\]
where, \(x_0\), is the center of the series expansion. More often than not we
will use the following form of the series.
\[
  f(x) = f(x_0+h) = f(x_0) + {1\over{1!}}\ f'(x) h + {1\over{2!}}\ f''(x) h^2
     + {1\over{3!}}\ f'''(x) h^3 + \cdots
\]
Note that in many of the problems where we will need the Taylor series we will
need to expand everything in an expression about a center, \(x_0\) and look at
the distance, \(h\), from that point.

So, on to some examples.

<hr>

<h2> Examples With Some Details: </h2>

<hr>

<h2> The Natural Exponential Function: </h2>
\vskip0.1in\noindent
The first and maybe most important example is the natural exponential function.
If \(f(x)=e^x\), then the derivatives we need are simply
\[
  f'(x_0) = e^{x_0},\ \ \  f''(x_0) = e^{x_0}, \ \ \ f'''(x_0)=e^{x_0}, \ldots
\]
with the \(n^{th}\) derivative being
\[
  f^{(n)}(x_0) = e^{x_0}
\]
Substituting all of this into the definition of the Taylor series gives the
following expansion.
\[
  e^x = e^{x_0} + e^{x_0} ( x - x_0 ) + {1\over 2} e^{x_0} ( x - x_0)^2 
      + {1\over {6}} e^{x_0} ( x - x_0 )^2 + \ldots
      = \sum_{k=0}^\infty\ {{e^{x_0}}\over{k!}}\ ( x - x_0 )^k
      = e^{x_0} \sum_{k=0}^\infty\ {{(x-x_0)^k}\over{k!}}
\]
or if we let \(h=x-x_0\)
\[
  e^x = e^{x_0} \sum_{k=0}^\infty\ {{h^k}\over{k!}}
\]
This Taylor series is very easy to compute due to the fact that the derivative
of the exponential function is itself.

In most calculus courses students are introduced to the Maclarin series where
the center of the series is \(x_0=0\). Since \(e^0=1\) the series becomes 
\[
  e^x = \sum_{k=0}^\infty\ {{x^k}\over{k!}}
\]
This series is used in many examples in calculus and as a basis for modeling
population problems and exponential growth and decay.

<h2> The Cosine Function: </h2>

<hr>

This example is a bit more difficult, but can be done with a little effort. We
will determine the Taylor expansion of \(f(x)=cos(x)\). The derivatives we need
in this case are
\[
  f'(x) = -sin(x),\ \ \ f''(x)=-cos(x),\ \ \ f'''(x)=sin(x),
    \ \ \ f''''(x)=cos(x) = f(x)
\] 
From this we see that the form of the derivative cycles after four derivatives.
So, we see a pattern that helps us write the general Taylor series. The series
with center \(x_0\) is
\[
  cos(x) = cos(x_0)
   - {{sin(x_0)}\over{1!}} ( x - x_0 )
   - {{cos(x_0)}\over{2!}} ( x - x_0 )^2
   + {{sin(x_0)}\over{3!}} ( x - x_0 )^3
   + {{cos(x_0)}\over{4!}} ( x - x_0 )^4 + \ldots
\]
In most calculus textbooks, the general series is not presented. Instead, the
Maclarin series with \(x_0=0\) is used as an example. This gives the more
commonly used series
\[
  cos(x) = 1 - {{x^2}\over{2!}} + {{x^4}\over{4!}} - \cdots
         = \sum_{k=0}^\infty\ {{(-1)^k x^{2k}}\over{(2k)!}}
\]

<hr>

<h2> The Sine Function: </h2>

<hr>

In this section, the Maclarin series for \(f(x)=sin(x)\) will be given without
any details. The series is
\[
  sin(x) = x - {{x^3}\over{3!}} + {{x^5}\over{5!}} - \cdots
         = \sum_{k=1}^\infty\ {{(-1)^{k+1} x^{2k-1}}\over{(2k-1)!}}
\]
It is not too hard to change the center of the series in these cases. It is not
that commonly done in mathematics courses.

<hr>

< h2> Taylor Series For A Logarithm Function: </h2>

<hr>

In this example, consider
\[
  f(x) = ln(1+x)
\]
This is a common example in second semester calculus courses. If we expand about
\(x_0=0\) we will obtain the following derivatives.
\begin{eqnarray*}
  f(0) & = & ln(1) = 0 \\
  f'(0) & = & {1\over{1+x}} \rightarrow f'(0) = 1, \\
  f''(0) & = & -{1\over{(1+x)^2}} \rightarrow f'(0)  = -1, \\
  f'''(0) & = & 2\ {1\over{(1+x)^3}} \rightarrow f'(0) = 2, \\
  f''''(0) & = & -6\ {1\over{(1+x)^4}} \rightarrow f'(0) = -6
\end{eqnarray*}
This can be repeated as many times as needed until a pattern is found.
Substituting these derivatives in gives
\[
  ln(1+x) = x - {1\over 2} x^2 + {1\over 3} x^3 - \cdots
          = \sum_{k=0}^\infty\ (-1)^{k+1} {{x^k}\over{k}}
\]

<hr>

<h2> Taylor Series Applied to Finite Difference Approximations: </h2> 

<hr>

In a couple of topics we have seen approximations of derivatives of functions
using difference quotients. This can be stated as
\[
   f'(x) \approx {{f(x+h)-f(x)}\over{h}}
\]
We can expand the terms in the expression using the following at the arbitrary
point, \(x\). This gives
\begin{eqnarray*}
  {1\over h} \left( f(x+h) - f(x) \right)
     & = & {1\over h} \left(
                    f(x) + f'(x) ( x + h - x) + {1\over 2} f''(x) ( x +h -x)^2
                      \cdots - f(x)
                  \right) \\
     & = & {1\over h} \left( f'(x) h + {1\over 2} f''(x) h^2 + \cdots \right) \\
     & = & f'(x) + {1\over 2} f''(x) h + \cdots \\
\end{eqnarray*}
The result of using a Taylor series approximation is that the difference
quotient is equal to the derivative of the function plus extra terms from the
Taylor series expansion.

We will take up this idea in the next topic in our list.
