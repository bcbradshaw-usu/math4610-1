{\bf Computational Accuracy: Machine Precision} 
\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in\noindent
In this topic the subjsct of finite representation of numbers and finite
precision of arithmetic will be considered. In most advanced mathematics
courses, one starts with the simplest sets of numbers and successively include
more and more types of numbers. It is typical to start out with the natural
numbers, \(\mathbb{N}\). This set can be defined by
\[
  \mathbb{N} = \left\lbrace 1, 2, 3, \ldots \right\rbrace
\]
If we stopped here we would still use the set of natural numbers in many
computational problems. The natural numbers or subsets of the natural numbers
are used to increment recursive process through looping structures.

The next set of number comes from adding the number zero to the set of natural
numbers. That is, define \(\mathbb{W}\) as
\[
  \mathbb{W} = \left\lbrace 0\right\rbrace \cub\mathbb{N}
             = \left\lbrace 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \right\rbrace 
\]
This set of numbers allows C, Python and other languages to start all arrays at
0 instead of 1, like Fortran.

Adding in the negatives of the natural numbers gives the set of integers defined
by
\[
  \mathbb{Z} = \left\lbrace \ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots \right\rbrace 
\]
The negative numbers in \(\mathbb{Z}\) can arise when doing index arithmetic in
arrays. Sometimes it may be a way of detecting an error in code.

At this point, all of the numbers considered, \(\mathbb{Z}\), can be represented
on a computer up to a upper limit on the value.

{{\bf :} Setting up a Repository} 
\vskip0.1in\hrule\vskip0.1in
\noindent
Once you log in, you will need to build a repository for use in the class and
to turn in homework and completed tasks and projects. For the course, you will
create a repository named the following:
\begin{verbatim}

    math4610

\end{verbatim}
Use only the characters above and using the following rules:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Use only lower case characters - github is case senesitive.
  \item Do not put any blanks in the name of the repository.
\end{enumerate}
Note that the instructor will use only this repository name in looking for your
work.

If you have an account on GitHub, you will already know a lot about these
things. However, when you are logged in you will see the main screen with any
repositories you may already have created. We will go through the steps to
build and name repositories in the next few pages.
