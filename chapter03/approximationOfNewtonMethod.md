## Approximation of Newton's Method

In many cases in root finding problems Newton's method may not be available due to a number of reasons:

1. the derivative cannot be directly computed,
2. the derivative is computationally difficult to compute, or
3. the function is represented by discrete data points.

In these cases, the iteration formula for Newton's method cannot be evaluated at each step of the iteration. So, the idea is to
develop alternate algorithms where the derivative in Newton's method is approximated. There are any number of ways that this can
be done. The most popular of these modifications results in the Secant Method.
