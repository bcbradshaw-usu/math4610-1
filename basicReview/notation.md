## Mathematical Concepts and Notation for Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics

This section presents mathematical notation that will be used through out the repository/book. It is important to have some type
of agreement on how to represent the mathematics we will use in the development of the mathematical problems and algorithms for
the approximate solution of the mathemtical problems we encounter. The content in this section provides an extremely brief 
review of some topics from algebra. The review is only on notation and analytic methods for solving mathematical problems needed 
in this book.

### Links To Notation By Mathematical Concept

Each of the following links will take you to a basic review of mathematical concepts that will be used in this text. The reviews
are basic and should not be considered as a thorough presentation of the material being reviewed. For example, in the reviews
associated with differential equations a couple of methods for the determination of an analytic solution of a specific class of
differential equations will be given. However, the review will not include an exhaustive list of solutions methods. Most
students in this course will have taken courses in ordinary differential equations and linear algebra. In addition, the
primary concern of this material is the approximate solution of mathematical problems. All we need to know about any
mathematical problem is that a solution exists. Once we know a solution exists, we can design any number of algorithms for the
approximate solution of the problem.
