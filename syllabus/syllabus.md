**Contact Comments:** You can contact your instructor in a number of ways. Email is, by far, the most reliable method of
contacting your instructor. If you call the number above, you may end up on the campus voicemail system. Note that messages on
the campus phone system are also forwarded to instructor email accounts with (possibly) a text translation. You should get used
to using the contact information above to set up appointments outside office hours and to ask questions about content in the

### Course Description






The following is a current version of the course description for 
[Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/main). The description will likely
change from time to time and this information may change. The current description is from the course as of Fall Semester 2018.
The official course description can be found on the [USU](http://www.usu.edu/) Course Catalog page.

>> mathematics and problem solving, including:  truncation and round-off error, algorithms to find solutions of nonlinear 
>> equations, numerical solution of linear systems by direct and iterative approaches, interpolation methods, numerical 
>> differentiation and quadrature rules. Prerequisite/Restriction: (1) MATH 1220, MATH 2250, or MATH 2270 with a C- or better

### Textbook:

The textbook for the course for Fall Semester 2018 is the following:

>> A First Course in Numerical in Numerical Methods. by Uri Ascher and Chen Greif

The book can be found at [SIAM](https://www.siam.org). You can search for the title or authors and then go from there.

### General Comments/Policies for Math 4610:

This course covers the development and implementation of fundamental algorithms in computational mathematics. The methods
and algorithms presented in the course are not in and of themselves used to approximately solve complicated mathematical 
problems. The algorithms comprise building blocks for complex algorithms that can be used to approximate many mathematical
and physical systems. The algorithms that will be covered include basic root finding methods, direct methods for approximate 
solution of linear systems of equations, matrix operations, eigenvalue and eigenvector computations, polynomial interpolation, 
numerical differentiation formulas, numerical integration formulas, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), along with other concepts 
related to computational mathematics. The lion's share of the work in this course will involve the implementation of algorithms 
using some higher level language (C, C++, Python, Fortran, Java, etc.) along with some analysis. Students will need to know how 
to apply theorems from a standard calculus course. The theorems will be presented without proof in this course. The main 
analytic tools you will need to use throughout the course are Taylor series, results from linear algebra related to row 
reduction, and results for eigenvalue and eigenvector calculations. It will be understandable if you do not quite remember 
everything when these results are presented. However, you should be able to review the topics from calculus, linear algebra, and 
other courses when needed. If, in the end, you are still having problems understanding the basic theorems, it will be important 
for you to talk over the theorems used in the class with me.

The course will involve significant computer programming assignments. Students must know how to write computer code in a high
level programming language (e.g; Fortran, C, C++, Java, and others) or work in a computational platform like Matlab or Maple.
If you choose to use Matlab or Maple, you will be required to implement your own versions of the algorithms discussed in class.
You can use the intrinsic routines to verify your code. For example, in Matlab there are simple expressions that will prompt the 
software within Matlab to compute an approximate solution of a linear system of equations. The nuts and bolts are buried deep in 
the software that Matlab provides. The point of this course is for each student to be able to fully implement algorithms. Using 
the software provided in Matlab does not allow this. There is another reason why students need to learn all the nuts and bolts 
that software like Matlab, Mathematica, and Maple cloak. When you are working in a job and need to ship software to your 
clients, Matlab, Mathematica, and Maple require expensive licensing for their part of the software. These packages are too 
expensive in most cases. So, you will need to write your own code.

Parallel algorithms for solving problems have been around for a long time. At first, these algorithms were interesting, but 
maintaining parallel codes can be diffcult. In the past decade, the limitations of the physics associated with computing have 
put limitations on the speed and capacity of a single CPU. Computer companies have started to put more processors into their 
computers with the idea of improving performance. GPUs have been included to off load the work needed for displaying graphics 
and the like onto a specialized parallel processing card. Ways to take advantage of multiple cores and CPUs and the GPU onboard 
your computer have been developed. Students in this course will gain some knowledge of how to use these tools. In particular, 
concepts from the directive based languages, OpenMP and OpenACC, will be presented to show students the benefits of multicore
processing the GPU processing.

### Turning in Homework and the Software Manual

To turn in your homework, you will need to supply (via email) a repository link that your instructor and "git" from
[Github](https://www.github.com). To grade/edit your homework, you will need to identify your homework repository as something
on which your instructor is a collaborator.

### Grading:

Your grade in the course will be determined by the following:
1. Homework will account for a 40% of a student's grade. Homework must be turned in on time. Late homework will not be accepted 
   under any circumstances. If you must be gone, any homework must be turned in before the due date. The only exception to this 
   rule is for a family emergency. Also, codes must be carefully documented. An example of a well documented code will be 
   discussed in class and a version will be posted on line.
2. Two midterms will be given. Each will cover about one half of the content of the course. Each of these midterms will account
   for 20% or 40% of the grade earned in the course. Note that the midterms will be comprised of about 5 or 6 short answer
   questions. The questions will be taken out of the textbook. There is a set of questions at the end of each chapter that will
   be used in determining the questions for the exam. The idea is that a number of these questions will be identified as
   possible exam questions. A subset of these questions will appear on the two midterms.
3. A _portfolio_ of routines will be required of each student. The portfolio of routines must be written in the form of a
   software manual. The exact form of the portfolio will be discussed in class. Based on past experience the formatting will be 
   strict in that the entries in the manual must be formatted using the
   [template](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/appendix02/softwareManualTemplate)
   included in the [Math 4610 repository](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/main). **There will be absolutely no 
   exceptions to this requirement!**. Assignments that do not meet the formatting requirements **will NOT be graded**. Part of
   the reason for putting strict is due to the idea that in a job, you will need to follow the company formatting to have your 
   algorithms included in bigger projects.
   
If students have questions about assignments and midterms, please contact me. One of the assignments will be to meet with me at 
least once every two weeks to discuss progress in the course. This means that 2 times each month during the semester you will 
need to show up at offce hours or make an appointment to see me. You will need to do this 8 times during the semester.
