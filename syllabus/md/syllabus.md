## USU Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics Course Description:

<hr>

This course presents fundamental topics and algorithms that are common to many
areas of computational mathematics. Topics include: truncation and round-off
error, basic numerical linear algebra (including Gaussian elimination and
calculation of eigenvalues), root-finding methods, interpolation methods, and
numerical differentiation/integration. Prerequisite: Math 1220 with a C- or
better in Math 2250 or 2270 with a C- or better in a high-level programming
language (C/C++, Python, Fortran) 

<hr>

## Computer Programming Requirements:

<hr>

If you have not completed a computer programming class, for example USU courses
CS 1400 Introduction to Computer Science - CS 1 and/or CS 1410 Introduction to
Computer Science - CS 2, you will **NOT** be able to complete this course.
This course is not intended to be a platform for learning a computer programming
language. Math 4610 is a course that is intended to provide students with an
opportunity to apply already mastered computer programming skills to algorithm
development and implementation. Students **MUST** be able to write computer
programs on the first day of class - **NO EXCEPTIONS**.

<hr>

## Textbook Information:

<hr>

There is no required textbook for Math 4610. Instead the course materials are
made freely available to students enrolled in Math 4610. The materials are
posted at the following online location:

Textbook Link:  [https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/](
    https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/)
 
The materials are available to any student or person interested in learning
about computational mathematics. There are a number of textbooks and other
materials that might be useful in working through the algorithms and also the
computational resources, like Github. References and links to these resources
will be made available at the link given above. Note that the materials at the
link above are governed by a Creative Commons License. This license allows free
use of the materials for noncommercial purposes. This includes any derivative
works from the materials at the Github site.

<hr>

## Additional References:

<hr>

There will be a number of topics that might arise during the semester. At the
instructor's discretion any materials needed for these topics will be provided
either in class, through handouts, or through posts to the instructor's main
web page.

Note that this syllabus is posted at both the instructor's site and also on the
Github site with link given above. Also, note that the syllabus will change from
year to year based on how the course evolves and the instructor teaching the
course in a current semester.

<hr>

## Additional Computer Skills:

<hr>

During the semester, students will be required to use a few more computational
tools to complete work. These include, but are not limited to the following
list:

1. **Command Line Terminals** Students will be required to use Linux/Unix
   terminals to complete many tasks. Basic usage will be covered in class and a
   Linux/Unix emulator (Cygwin) has been installed for public use in the
   Engineering Lab on campus. Students that have a Linux box or are able to
   install Cygwin on a personal laptop will be a bit better off.

2. **git** Students will need to master the use of "git" as a part of the class.
   Note that git is automatically installed with Cygwin. So, git is available
   on the Engineering Computer lab. 

3. **Github Account** Students must be able to create a Github account to
   interface work in the class with a publicly available repository. This will
   be covered in class.

4. **Graphical Output** Students must be able to produce graphs and other
   visual aids for homework tasks. This will be covered in class.

<hr>

## Instructor Course Comments:

<hr>

This course is intended for advanced undergraduate students and graduate
students who have already taken Math 2270 Linear Algebra **and** Math 2280
Ordinary Differential Equations **or** Math 2250 Linear Algebra and Ordinary
Differential Equations. The content will contain methods for the approximate
solution of simple mathematical problems through algorithms implemented into a
high level computer programming language. The basic mathematics skill set needed
for this course provides the backbone for computational mathematics and more
advanced courses in numerical analysis and computational mathematics. However,
you should not be enrolled in the course if you have not learned to write
computer programs in a high level programming language (e.g, C, C++, Python,
Fortran, or Java). If you have not taken a course in computer science, you will
need to drop the course and complete a course like CS 1410 at USU.

1. The course meets three days per week. We will be covering a lot of material
   in each and every class meeting. 

2. Although role will not be taken, students are required to attend this course
   in the sense that lectures will not be repeated. Students are expected to
   attend all classes and participate in discussions during class time. Time
   will be taken in each lecture to answer questions about material previously
   presented.

3. It is highly recommended that students take notes during class to keep up
   with the material presented and to keep up with the lectures.

4. Be on time! Most students in this course will take professional jobs that
   require an employee to be on time. This course is no different.

If you have any questions about the course material, course policies, or any
other matters, please contact the instructor for the course via email, before
or after class, or during office hours.

## Why No Matlab or Mathematica:

<hr>

Students often ask questions about Matlab and/or Wolfram Alpha as options for
writing programs. There are two important reasons for not allowing Matlab as a
programming language. These are the following:

1. First, in many of the intrinsic routines, most of the details are buried in
   the code written by people employed at the Math Works (the people who produce
   Matlab). This means that students will not see the nuts and bolts of how
   numerical algorithms work. There is a lot that is learned when you debug a
   code that you or one of your colleagues have created to solve a problem.

2. **Cost!!!** While at USU, the cost for licensing Matlab or Maple is more than
   reasonable. However, corporate licensing is very expensive. It is highly
   unlikely that any company will want to license another product along with
   their own code. Students need to know how to write their own code, including
   the hidden details in intrinsic routines. This course assumes students want
   to learn these details.

Note that Mathematica, Matlab, or Maple are great tools for prototyping ideas in
applied and computational mathematics. Your instructor works in Matlab
occasionally and used to use Mathematica extensively. However, your instructor
never needed to purchase a license for these products. These tools were
purchased within the structure of a grant proposal or by USU IT with huge
educational discounts.

<hr>

## Grading:

<hr>

Your grade in the course will be determined by the following:

1. Each student is required to meet with the instructor in the instructor's
   office during the first two weeks of the semester and prior to each of the
   exams described below during posted office hours or by making an
   appointment. This will count as one homework assignment.

2. Homework will account for a 35% of a student's grade. Homework must be
   turned in on time. **Under normal conditions late homework will not be
   accepted.** If you must be gone, any homework must be turned in on or before
   the due date. The only exception to this rule is for a family emergency.
   Also, homework must legible. Much of your work will be done using "git" and
   made available for grading using Github. This will mean that most of your
   homework will be typed. There will be times when a scanned, handwritten
   solution will be appropriate. Make sure these solutions are legible and the
   scan of the work is readable. There will be a temptation to scan work in
   using a smart phone. If you do, make sure things are lined up and easy to
   read.

3. Students will be required to create a software manual to document the
   algorithms developed during the semester. This will account for 15% of the
   overall grade in the course. The software manual will be comprised of short
   descriptions of the algorithms developed and implemented in this class. For
   each piece of code that is developed in the class there must be an entry in
   your software manual. The format for the software manual pages will be fixed.
   An example of the format can be found at the following link:

   https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/appendix02/softwareManualTemplate

   We will discuss this in some detail during the first week of the semester. 

4. Two midterms will be given. Each will cover about one half of the content of
   the course. Each of these midterms will account for 15% or 30% of the grade
   earned in the course.

5. A comprehensive exam will be given during finals week. The final will account
   for 20% percent of the overall grade in the course.

If students have questions about assignments, the software manual, midterms, 
and/or final please contact your instructor. One of the assignments will be to
meet with me at least once before each exam to discuss progress in the course.
This means that 3 times during the semester you will need to show up during
office hours or make an appointment to see your instructor.

    academic exercise or activity be done "individually"; (2) depending on the
    aid of sources beyond those authorized by the instructor in writing papers,
    preparing reports, solving problems, or carrying out other assignments; (3)
    substituting for another student, or permitting another student to
    substitute for oneself, in taking an examination or preparing academic work;
    (4) acquiring tests or other academic material belonging to a faculty
    member, staff member, or another student without express permission; (5)
    continuing to write after time has been called on a quiz, test, examination,
    or any other academic exercise or activity; (6) submitting substantially the
    same work for credit in more than one class, except with prior approval of
    the instructor; or (7) engaging in any form of research fraud.

2.  **Falsification:** altering or fabricating any information or citation in an
    academic exercise or activity.

3.  **Plagiarism:** representing, by paraphrase or direct quotation, the
    published or unpublished work of another person as one's own in any academic
