# Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics

## Development of Math 4610

This course was developed by [Joe Koebbe](http://www.math.usu.edu/~koebbe) at
[Utah State University](http://www.usu.edu) in the [Department of Mathematics
and Statistics](http://www.math.usu.edu/). The course is intended for students
in the [College of Science](https://www.usu.edu/science), the College of Engineering, and any other
students who have completed a basic course in linear algebra (e.g, Math 2270 Linear Algebra) AND ordinary differential
equations (e.g, Math 2280 Ordinary Differential Equations). Students who have completed the combined course Math 2250
are also well qualified to be in this course. Primarily, the course presents computational methods for the approximate solution 
of a number of mathematical problems. The amount of analysis needed is minimal (e.g, Taylor series and knowledge of results from 
Linear Algebra). The goal is to introduce students into the world of computer coding and simulation. Later courses (e.g,
Math 5610 and Math 6610) treat analysis of the methods at a more advanced level.

## Introduction to the Course

This course presents content related to basic scientific computing problems. Students are asked to (1) implement algorithms
from a basic numerical methods course (e.g, Newton's method for finding roots), (2) use techniques from calculus, linear
algebra, and differential equations to do basic analysis of errors (e.g, Taylor series expansion and computation of
eigenvalues and eigenvectors), and (3) build shared libraries based on the code written (e.g, archives on Linux or DLLs on
Windows), (4) document the work done in a software manual, and (5) implement efficient versions of algorithms using parallel
programming techniques (e.g, OpenMP and OpenACC).

Each of the items just listed is viewed as an important part of being a computational mathematics/scientific computing expert.
There are also real reasons why it is important that students are well prepared in each of these skill sets. It is ultimately
important that any student in this course is able to implement simple algorithms in a native coding language (say C or Java). 
There are some in these areas that would say that implementation of algorithms using a computational platform like Matlab is a 
better way to teach algorithm implementation. However, if a student is hired into a software development company or a position 
within a large company to write software, Matlab is usually too expensive to use. In an academic setting Matlab is usually a 
great way to prototype ideas. The built in functionality and graphical interfaces are great for testing ideas in many areas of 
mathematics and sience. However, incorporating Matlab and any other of these platforms requires a larger financial committment. 
More importantly, computational mathematicians are constantly faced with problems where it is important to be able to debug and
write new code that modifies an existing piece of software. For example, it might be important to rewrite code to work on
multiple cores on a desktop. This may mean digging into existing code and rewriting the code. This is a skill set that all
computational mathematics professionals must have. Using simple algorithms as a means to present these ideas is the best
approach.

The basic mathematical techniques from calculus and for that matter any other area of mathematics, is important in determining
the range of problems to which an approximate solution technique can be applied. Knowing the limitations of various methods
applied to classes of problems is invaluable. For example, it might be necessary to apply an iterative method (e.g, Jacobi
iteration or the conjugate gradient method) to a linear system of equations versus a direct method (e.g, LU-factorization) to
a given linear system of equations. It is important to know which methods will perform the best in terms of accuracy of the
approximation that is produced and the amount of computational effort needed by these methods.

The third point is an important skill set in terms of how many codes and packages are implemented. This is a minor point in
the course, but helps students understand how reusable code can be created in the implementation of algorithms. For example, if
one code for the solution of nonlinear scalar equations can be used, a computational mathematician should be able to write code
that can be used to solve a variety of these types of problems. Embedding a new version of an algorithm in each new application
code written is incredibly inefficient. In most high level languages from C and Fortran and including Python and Java there are
tools for creating these packages and libraries. Calling routines from a shared library slows down the execution of any code.
However, most compilers these days, are smart enough to in-line codes through some compiler options. In fortran, most compilers
allow the user to put in something like a -Bstatic flag to create a static image of the executable code. The tradeoff in this
case is the size of the binary image of the application versus the speed of executation. Static images are typically larger than
images that link to shared libraries. Inlining a code reduces the execution time due to the reduction of references to shared
libraries. Ultimately, a computational mathematician should know how to take advantage of this balance.

Documentation of work is fundamental to any scientific endeavor. So, students at USU are asked to created a software manual for
the code they write. The intent of this project is to get students to effectively communicate their work from the course. The
software manual has been placed on Github using markdown language. From the point of view of a skill set, using Github as a
platform to create a software manual also gives coding nerds experience with a social media application that can be used to
contact other computer programmers who are interested in the same types of problems.

When a computational mathematician is hired into a software development job, it is likely the case that a format for the 
documentation of software already exists. So, adapting to the documentation format will be required. In terms of grading for
a course like the one described in this repository, it is important to create a standard way of documenting the software
written. A software manual is provided to students. The format is given later in this introduction. Using Github and markdown
language makes this assignment a lot easier to complete. Students are asked to start the software manual in the first week of
the class so that students get used to the work it takes.

The last skill set listed above is using the full capabilities of modern computing hardware. Almost all computers now come with
multiple cores (multiple CPUs) and Graphics Computing Units (GPUs) that provide a wealth of additional computational horsepower.
In recent years, limitations of a single CPU have stopped the every advancing performance of computers. To aid in the
performance of hardware, computer vendors have started producing more performance through the addition of multiple cores and
GPUs for enhancing graphcial displays. These resources can be used by computational mathematicians to improve the computational
efficiency of the software they develop. In the past few years language extensions, such as OpenMP and OpenACC, have been
developed to take advantage of these hardware resources. The content in this course touches on these two language extensions in
the implementation of algorithms for the approximate solution of mathematical problems. The reader should note that there are a
number of gotchas in using these extensions. These occur on both the hardware and software ends of the implementation. For
example, most GPUs that ship with desktops are geared for graphical displays. This means that errors can occur in computations
that are not corrected. This is fine for graphical displays, but can cause problems in scientific computing. However, one can
purchase standalone GPUs that have error correcting memory that can be used in scientific computing. More will be covered as
these topics arise in presentation of content in the course.

## Software Manual Description and Template

One project students have been asked to do in Math 4610 is to create a software manual for the codes that are written by the
semester. The software manual project requires students include well written, concise descriptions of the algorithms and codes
developed throughout the course. Students can use github to easily create the software manual with a template (see the link
below) to create a consistent looking description. Students are encouraged to organize the software manual so that codes
written to solve a similar or the same problem should be located together (e.g, the Bisection method and Newton's method for
finding roots of a nonlinear function of a single variable). Students are asked to build all routines including routines to
compute errors, do basic linear algebra operations, and other basic routines that are needed in support of the main algorithms
presented in the course.
