# Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics

## Welcome

This site provides links to materials used in teaching a single one semester course in the Department of Mathematics and
Statistics at Utah State University (USU). The course, Math 4610 Fundamentals of Numerical Analysis is a course for computational
mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers, and some business majors - for example economics majors. The course is intended
to give students in computational areas a starting point for implementation of algorithms, development of reusable computer
codes, and information on how to get started with parallel computing platform (e.g, multicore programming, graphics processing
units, threads in Java, and other topics.
