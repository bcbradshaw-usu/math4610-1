# Introduction to Computational Mathematics

The purpose of this repository is to provide materials (for free) to users/readers who want to work in computational mathematics. The
two words, computational mathematics, can encompass a lot of different content. In this repository, computational mathematics will
include any of the following topics and related materials.

1. Definition, development, and implementation of algorithms into high level programming languages (e.g., python, C/C++, and/or Java)
2. Using computational resources efficiently to produce accurate approximations to solutions of mathematical problems (e.g, solving
   linear systems of equations or computing approximate solutions for differential equations) that occur in real world problems.
3. Using HPC resources to implement parallel and vector versions of mathematical algorithms to take advantadge of multiple cores or
   scientitic Graphical Processing Units (GPUs).
4. Using multithreading in languages like Java to improve the efficiency and performance of algorithms.
