## Measurement Errors

Measurement errors in scientific endeavors come in many ways. In just about any physical problem that requires experiments to
study the processes involved one must make measurements. There are at least two ways that measurement errors can occur. The
first type of measurement error comes when direct measurements of a physical processes are obtained. For example, measuring
a fish population in the Bering Sea will inevitably have errors. Making sure that fisheries are sustainable is very
important and accurate estimates of fish populations is crucial in efforts to maintain the fishery. Another source of
measurement may come from the instrument used to make a measurement. Lidar devices provide remote measurements of temperature
in various layers of the upper atmosphere. There are a number of different lidar instruments (along with other devices) that
can be used to obtain these measurements. The accuracy of these devices is dependent on a number of device dependent
quantities. In most cases, a formula is used to estimate errors in the measurements and accuracy of the devices. These types
of errors depend on the equipment and not the physical process.
