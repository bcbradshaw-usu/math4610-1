# Introduction to Computational Mathematics: Some Examples

In this chapter a discussion of the skill sets a computational mathematics must have to be successful. Although the material in
this chapter is not essential to being successful in a computational mathematics course like Math 4610 at USU, it is a good idea
to understand the skill set needed to be successful in computational mathematics and/or scientific computing. If you want to get
directly into the material in the repository, it is ok to skip this chapter and go directly to 
[Chapter 2](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/chapter02/intro).
