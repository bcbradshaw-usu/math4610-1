## Preface for Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics

The content in this repository is a work in progress for those of us (students
and faculty) at Utah State University (USU). There will be (are) several
contributors to this work. First, the students who have this (and other)
course(s) have taught the author more and better computing tricks and should be
given credit for these contributions. This is due to the fact that students
tend to keep up on new and better computational toys than one aging professor
([There is a joke in there somewhere!](http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/mathjokes.html)).
The author has learned and forgotten enumerable coding languages and
computational tricks over a number decades. It is expected that other
instructors of Math 4610 at USU will embrace this material. The expectation is
that this repository will evolve into a set of freely available materials that
students can use during the course and after completing the course for as long
as this repository is maintained and/or Github continues to be so easy to use.

The initial version of this repository was created and maintained by
[Joe Koebbe](http://www.math.usu.edu/~koebbe). The author has over 35 years of
experience writing code for simulation of black oil reservoirs with an
internship with Chevron Oil Field Research Company (when it was called that) to
Fishery Simulators written in Java for the Alaska Fisheries Science Center
(AFSC) in Seattle, WA. Many of the projects in the repository have been studied
and worked on by the author and a number of undergraduate and graduate students.

### Warantees, Disclosures, and Open Educational Resources (OER) at USU

All, including anyone out on the internet are welcome to use this repository for
learning and teaching topics commonly used in computational mathematics. There
are loads of algorithms and other computational ideas that have and will be
included in this repository. Some of the material is based on current hardware
and software. As things change it is hoped that the material in the repository
will keep up with newer methods and technologies.



If you find errors in the materials or typos, please send e-mail to the author
at [joe.koebbe@usu.edu](mailto:joe.koebbe@usu.edu). I will try to get to the
comments and errors as fast as I can take care of them. In other words, be a bit
patient with corrections and modifications to the material. The material in this
repository comes as is with the usual caveats for misuse and the like.

### MathJax and Notation

Mathematics in this repository is displayed using
[MathJax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/index.html) and regular html files
that contain bits of mathematics embedded in the html. For example, click on the
following link to see what this might look like in a web page:
[MathJax Test](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/frontMatter/mathjaxTest.html).  

### Graphics Formatting in the Text

Also, graphics displayed in the text are in GIF image files/format. A test case
for the following image

!["Test.gif not found"](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/images/test.gif)

is available at this link:

["test.gif"](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/images/test.gif)

Note that you should be able to look at the .md file for this preface. The html/img tags and such can be copied directly from 
the file, [preface.md](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/frontMatter/preface.md). Note that the inclusion should work for any
graphics format (e.g, JPEG and BMP)
