    Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics: Homework 4 Problems
  </h1>
  <hr>
  <ol type="1">
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Write a routine that will perform Gaussian elimination on a square matrix. Return the result of the operation
      in the input array. That is, overwrite the orginal array with the elimination.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Repeat the work in the previous problem but for a general rectangular matrix.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Write a routine to perform forward substitution on a square lower triangular matrix.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Write a routine to perform back substitution on a square upper triangular matrix.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Combine the routines from the previous problems to form a routine to solve square linear systems of equations.
      That is, reuse the routines you have already created through instantiation, calling with arguments, etc. Download the
           <a href="https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/">
             Resource for Matrices: Linear System of Equations
           </a>
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Create a new routine from your Gaussian Elimination routine that saves the multiplication factors and contains
      the information for a LU-factorization of a square matrix.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Combine routines from previous problems in this homework set to solve a square linear system of equations using
      LU-factorization.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Implement a version of the Cholesky factorization for symmetric matrices. Include an entry in your software
      manual for the Cholesky factorization routine you code up. Include a simple example with the entry. Use a square matrix
      that is $5\times 5$ to illustrate.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Download the system defined at the link below and test your Cholesky factorization code on the matrix.

             Resource for Matrices: Linear System of Equations
           </a>
         Analyze and explain your results.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Write a code that solves a linear system of equations using the Cholesky factorization from the previous
      problem. You will need to use an appropriate forward and backsubstituion routine. These should alreay be in place if you
      have successfully completed all the problems in this homework set.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Use an online search to find web sites and/or web pages that identify test problems for linear solvers. Write
      a summary of at least two of these sites. Download and include these examples in your software manual or provide links to
      the sites you use to test your own linear solution codes.
