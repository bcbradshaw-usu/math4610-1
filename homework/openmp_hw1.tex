    Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics: Homework 1 Problems
  </h1>

  <ol type="1">
    <li> Problem: Write a code that will return machine precision for your computer (or any other computer for that matter) in
      single precision arithmetic. Give the method a name that is descriptive. For example, maceps(), or something like that.
      The routine should return the default machine precision. Create a second routine that will return the machine precision
      in double precision computations. Give the routine a unique name, say dmaceps(). Make sure that your code is fully
      documented with you as the author and so on. An example of a Fortran code is included in this repository. You can
      translate this into a Python, C, or C++ code to do the work. You can also modify the Fortran and use this directly.
    </li>
    <li> Problem: Using OpenMP, write code that will simultaneously compute roots of a function by subdividing an interval
      that may have multiple roots of a given function. This amounts to inputting an interval on which multiple roots exist.
      Then choose a starting point or points (based on the root finding method selected) and use the parallelization structure
      to have the method converge..
