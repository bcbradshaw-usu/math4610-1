    Math 4610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics: Homework 5 Problems
  </h1>

  <ol type="1">
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Write a piece of code that implements the power method for the computation of the largest eigenvalue (in
      magnitude) for a square matrix. Make sure that you produce an entry in your software manual. As an example, use the
      method for the production of a square matrix from the last assignment.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Write a piece of code that implements the inverse power method for the computation of the largest eigenvalue
      (in magnitude) for a square matrix. Make sure that you produce an entry in your software manual. As an example, use the
      method for the production of a square matrix from the last assignment.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Write code that uses the code from the previous two problems to estimate the 2-condition number of a matrix.
      Put this code in your software manual with an example using the matrix generation code from the previous assignment.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Write an OpenMP version of the power method for the computation of the largest eigenvalue of a matrix.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Write an OpenMP version of the inverse power method for the computation of the largest eigenvalue of a matrix.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Write a code that will compute the 2-condition number of a matrix using your OpenMP code for the power method
      and inverse power method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Compare the 2-condition number codes with and without the OpenMP directives. Which is faster?
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Use the code you developed in the last problem set to generate a diagonally dominant matrix of various sizes
      to test the condition number code using both your non-parallel and parallel codes. Do this for matrices of size
      $40\times40$, $80\times80$, $160\times 160$, $320\times 320$, and $640\times 640$. Report your results for both time and
      accuracy. Tabulate (and graph) the time it takes your codes to run.
