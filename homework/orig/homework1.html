    Math 5610 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics: Homework 2 Problems
  </h1>

  <ul>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 1: Email the link to your repository and table of contents for
         your completed homework tasks. I understand that this is a very easy
         task. Make sure that the link is an absolute link. The link should be
         to the username.github.io repository for the css formatted version.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 2: Implement a method/routine that computes and returns the
         absolute error in the approximation of a number $x$ by another number
         $y$. Also create an entry for the method in your software manual.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 3: Implement a method/routine that computes and returns the
         relative error in the approximation of a number $x$ by another number
         $y$. Also create an entry for the method in your software manual.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 4: Implement a method that will add two vectors of the same
         length. Also create an entry for the method in your software manual.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 5: Implement a method that will return a scalar multiple of a
         given vector. The method should require a vector and number for the
         operation. Add an entry to your software manual for this method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 6: Implement a method that will compute the 2-norm of an arbitrary
         vector will real number entries. Add an entry to your for the method
         you create
    </li>
  
    <li> Task 7: Implement a method that will compute the 1-norm of an arbitrary
         vector will real number entries. Add an entry to your for the method
         you create
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 8: Implement a method that will compute the $\infty$-norm of an
         arbitrary vector will real number entries. Add an entry to your for the
         method you create
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 9: Write a routine that will generate a symmetric matrix that has
         real values in all entries of the matrix. Add an entry to your for the
         method you create
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 10: Search the internet for sites that discuss matrix norms. Look
         for sites that explain induced matrix norms. Write a brief summary of
         what you find. Limit the discussion to no more than two or three
         paragraphs and include links to the sites you cite.
