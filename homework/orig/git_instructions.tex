{\bf Introduction: Using Git for Version Control (VCS)}

\medskip
\noindent
In the development of complex software projects with a lot of people working on
various aspects of the project, it is important to be able to keep track of
progress. VCS systems can be used to control modification to master copy of the
software package. The VCS that will be used in this course will be git. This VCS
has been around for a number of years and has been used in the development of
Unix kernels developed by a large number of people.

Git is easy to use and this handout will provide an example on how to start
using git. Git is typically accessed through a Linux or Unix command terminal.
Command terminals can be opened on just about any computer, including Windows
computers. There are a couple of ways to get started..
\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\usecounter{beans} \parsep=0pt \listparindent=0pt
\topsep=0pt \rightmargin=.35in \leftmargin=.35in \labelsep=5 pt
\itemsep=2pt}
  \item If you are running a Linux or Unix system, you can open a terminal to
        bring up a window to work in.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\noindent
\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\bf Lecture: First Day} 
    \begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\usecounter{beans} \parsep=0pt \listparindent=0pt
    \topsep=0pt \rightmargin=.35in \leftmargin=.35in \labelsep=5 pt
    \itemsep=2pt}
      \item Cover the syllabus for the course. The syllabus should cover basic
            information about
            \begin{enumerate}
              \item the instructor including contact information, office
                    location, webpage links,
              \item general course content description, 
              \item what is expected in terms of homework,
              \item exams and exam dates,
              \item general USU, Department, and instructor policies, and
              \item how assignments and exams will be graded.
            \end{enumerate}
      \item Students must be familiar with command windows or terminals for
            command line interaction with Unix, Linux, or Cygwin Unix emulation
            to be successful in the course. We will spend some time introducing
            these ideas using Cygwin. Interactive Develement Environments (IDEs)
            will not do the work in this course. Note that for USU students, a
            version of Cygwin has been installed and is available in the
            Engineering Lab on the third floor of the building.
      \item Students must choose a programming language for use in the course:
            It will be best to choose a computer programming language and stick
            with the language throughout the semester. This means you should be
            proficient with at least one native programming languages. Students
            should use one of the following:
            \begin{enumerate}
              \item C, You can use gcc
              \item C++, You can use g++
              \item Fortran, You can use gfortran
              \item Python - Use python for Cygwin/Linux
              \item Java - Download and use the Java SDK from Oracle.
            \end{enumerate}
      \item Installing/working with git: Git is a Version Control System (VCS)
            that was first developed and used to distribute the work of building
            and maintaining the kernel for Unix/Linux systems. Note that git can
            easily be obtained as a package along with Cygwin.
      \item Get on Github: We will use Github for this course. This means you
            will need to set up an account on Github. This is where you can
            share work done in the course.
      \item Compiling an example code: create helloworld.exe from a text file.
            This will be done to emphasize how students are to complete homework
            problems for the material.
      \item Computing Machine Precision: compute the machine $\epsilon$ in 
            single or double precision - first ideas on sources of errors in
            computation. This example will be completed by students and turned
            in at the next course.
      \item Compilation, development of reusable code, and starting a software
            manual on Github. The software manual is a writing project that will
            tie the algorithms together.
      \item If time permits, examples of how to set up a laptop or tablet for
            the course will be presented. For example, how one can install a
            platform like Cygwin. Also, discussion of other options like Linux
            or Bash on Ubuntu for Windows. Another issue involves use of text
            editors like {\bf vi} or {\bf vim}.
    \end{list}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \item {\bf Lecture: Repositories, Sharing Libraries, and Test Codes} 
    \begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\usecounter{beans} \parsep=0pt \listparindent=0pt
    \topsep=0pt \rightmargin=.35in \leftmargin=.35in \labelsep=5 pt
    \itemsep=2pt}
      \item Questions from the previous lecture.
      \item Using \lq\lq git\rq\rq\ to complete homework assignments. Some time
            in this lecture will be spent going over how to use {\bf git} to
            create a repository and how to build files and other features in a
            repository. We will go through some specific examples of git
            commands and how to add, delete, modify, and commit changes to a
            repository. Students will need to master the use of git to turn in
            homework.
      \item As an example of using git, students will compile an example code:
            helloworld.exe from a text file. Students will learn how to include
            the files and output from the file into a repository.
      \item The second example of using git will involve computing machine
            precision. How to compute the machine epsilon in any precision -
            first ideas on sources of errors in computation.
      \item Compilation, reuse of code, and starting a shared library of object
            modules and how to document work via a software manual.
      \item If time permits at the end of class, more examples of how to set up
            laptops and compile code will be discussed. Examples of compiling
            codes in C, C++, Fortran, Java, and Python, although Python does not
            need compiling.

  \item {\bf Lecture: Accuracy Using the Difference Quotient for the Derivative}
    \begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\usecounter{beans} \parsep=0pt \listparindent=0pt
    \topsep=0pt \rightmargin=.35in \leftmargin=.35in \labelsep=5 pt
    \itemsep=2pt}
      \item Questions from the previous lecture.
      \item A mathematical example of errors in the determination of an
            approximate formula for the derivative of a function in one
            independent variable.
      \item Definition of truncation error when using approximations of analytic
            formulas. The definition of the derivative will be reviewed and used
            as a means to obtain an approximation of the derivative.
      \item Analysis of the difference quotient as an approximation of the
            first derivative using Taylor series expansions. We will briefly
            review Taylor series normally presented in the second semester of an
            engineering calculus sequence. At USU, the prerequisite course is
            Math 1220 Calculus II.
      \item Coding up the approximation of the finite difference approximation
            and testing the code. Note that the code will produce a numerical
            value and the results will be \lq\lq verified\rq\rq\ using a known
            derivative. A general discussion of the computation of the error
            will start with this example.
      \item The end of class will be used to go over any details from previous
            classes.

  \item {\bf Lecture: Truncation Error versus Roundoff Error} 
    \begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\usecounter{beans} \parsep=0pt \listparindent=0pt
    \topsep=0pt \rightmargin=.35in \leftmargin=.35in \labelsep=5 pt
    \itemsep=2pt}
      \item Questions from the previous lecture.
      \item Formally define truncation error and roundoff error related to
            machine precision.
      \item Define the terms absolute error and relative (or percent) error.
            This part of the lecture will include examples involving
            sensitivity of errors to small changes or perturbations in the
            numerical computations.
      \item How roundoff errors can be accumulate through computationally
            intensive algorithms. One example involves the approximate solution
            of linear systems of equations or systems of differential equations.
      \item Discussion of the two sources of error in the context of a finite
            difference approximation from the previous lecture. Students will
            see how to compute both absolute error and relative error for this
            example.
      \item Interval Analysis and the accumulation of roundoff error. Interval
            analysis allows a computational mathematicians to determine bounds
            on how errors accumulate over a large number of computations.
      \item Another related topic involves selecting \lq\lq stable\rq\rq
            algorithms for solution of real problems. Stable algorithms are less
            sensitive to accumulation of errors.
      \item Determining the efficiency of an algorithm. An effective means for
            determining efficiency is to count the number of Floating Point
            OPerations (flops) it takes to complete the algorithm.
      \item Tradeoffs between accuracy of an approximation versus efficiency of
            the algorithm used to compute the approximation will be discussed in
            terms of the examples already presented to this point.
      \item Ideas on practical methods to efficiently compute the number of
            flops needed to complete an algorithm.
