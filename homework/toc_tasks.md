# Prerequisite Problems:

The following is a link to a set of problems that represent computational skills students must know before taking a course like Math
4610. These problems should be relatively easy for a student who has completed the prerequisite courses for Math 4610. Students may be
asked to complete these problems as a means of testing prerequisite skills. The intent of this assignment is to make sure students have
the best possible chance of success in the course.

# Homework Sets and Computational Projects:

The following list provides links to the homework assignments to be completed by students in Math 4610 Fundamentals of
Computational Mathematics. The problem sets are geared to a one semester course. Due dates for all homework and projects are
set by the instructor for the semester. If you have questions, contact the instructor for the course you are taking.

# Presentations and Talks from Invited Lectures:

Over the past few semesters, faculty from the USU campus have been invited to talk about topics in computational mathematics during 
class time in Math 4610. The following provide links to slides that the speakers have used during their lectures. Note that the slides
have been exported to pdf when necessary.

## Fall Semester 2018:
