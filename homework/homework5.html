  <ol type="1">
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Write code that computes the induced matrix norm using the $l_1$ and $l_\infty$ norms. Include entries in
      your software manual along with some simple examples to illustrate the usage of the code that you have created.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Write piece of code that will initialize a square matrix so that the matrix has uniformly distributed
      numbers and is symmetric and diagonally dominant. The code should (1) initialize the entries in the upper triangular and
      diagonal entries of the matrix, (2) reflect the values in the upper triangular part of the matrix into the lower
      triangular portion of the matrix, and (3) add a large enough entry (in magnitude) to the diagonal entry to ensure the
      matrix is diagonally dominant. Also, write a piece of code that will generate the right hand side of a system of equations
      by multiplying the matrix above into a vector of ones. You should put an entry in your software manual that documents
      this code and how to use the code to generate test problems.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Write code that implements Jacobi iteration for the solution of linear systems of equations. Test your
      code on a random, symmetric, diagonally dominant matrix and right hand side as described in the previous problem.
      Make sure that you include an entry in your software manual.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Write code that implements Gauss-Seidel iteration for the of linear systems of equations. Test your code on
      a random, symmetric, diagonally dominant matrix and right hand side as described in the previous problem. Make sure that
      you include an entry in your software manual.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Write code that implements the method of Steepest Descent (the Gradient method) for the solution of linear
      systems of equations. Test your code on a random, symmetric, diagonally dominant matrix and right hand side as described
      in the previous problem. Make sure that you include an entry in your software manual.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Write code that implements the conjugate gradient method for the solution of linear systems of equations.
      Test your code on a random, symmetric, diagonally dominant matrix and right hand side as described in the previous
      problem. Make sure that you include an entry in your software manual.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: In this problem, you will need to implement a matrix-vector code that uses OpenMP. Use the code to perform
      the matrix-vector operation in your Jacobi iteration code. Create a new version of the Jacobi iteration that uses the
      OpenMP implementation of the produce. Test your code on the same matrix that you used for the test of the vanilla
      Jacobi iteration.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Repeat the work on the previous problem for the Gauss-Seidel iteration.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Repeat the work on the previous problem for the conjugate gradient method.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Problem: Compare the methods in this assignment on linear systems of equations of size $40\times40$, $80\times80$,
      $160\times 160$, $320\times 320$, and $640\times 640$. That is, create matrices and right hand sides to match as suggest
      in the problems above. Compare the methods in terms of number of iterations and cpu time. Produce a graph that visualizes
      the work and describe what the results tell us about the various methods.
