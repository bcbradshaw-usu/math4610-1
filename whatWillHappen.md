# This page will present the content of the course in terms of some broad computational issues. These include

1. General Skills for Writing codes that work,

   a. optimization of the code
   
   b. limitations of basic compilers
   
   c. how to organize reusable code in shared libraries or Dynamic Load Libraries (DLL)
   
2. Implementation of Basic Algorithms - not necessarily the most important part of the course

3. High Performance Computing (HPC)

   a. multicore programming (openMP)
   
   b. GPU programming (openACC)
   
   c. Java threads
   
   d. Message Passing Interface (MPI)
   
4. New computational resources

   a. Quantum Computing
   
   b. Github and other versioning software systems - students will be required to open an account on Github
