  <ul>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 1: Set up an appointment to meet with your instructor via Zoom.
         To do this, (1) email your instructor to set up a meeting time, (2)
         obtain the invitation link from email from your instructor, and (3)
         join the Zoom meeting. This should take just a few minutes.
    </li>
    <li> Task 2: Email a link to your Github page. The links should be of the
         form
         <pre>

             https://username.github.io/

         </pre>
         where the \lq\lq username\rq\rq\ is the name you chose when setting up
         your account. Your instructor should be able to see your repositories 
         and any public files that are on the repository.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 3: In class we discussed the creation of a repository for your
         work in this course. Once you have created a private repository named
         <pre>

             math4610

         </pre>
         do the folloinwg. Make sure that the repository is private and that the
         only other collaborator is the instructor for the class.
         The instructor email is contained in the syllabus for the course and
         can be accessed as follows.
         <pre>

             https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/syllabus/md/syllabus

         </pre>
         or
         <pre>

             https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/syllabus/pdf/syllabus.pdf

         </pre>
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 4: Email your instructor as to which command line environment you
         will use in the course. Possible choices are: Cygwin, Linux, MacOS,
         or Windows. If you plan on emulating your instructor, you should
         install Cygwin. Installation of Cygwin is not required for the course.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 5: Email the instructor the link to the table of contents for your
         homework solutions. The link should be something like
         <pre>

             https://username.github.io/math4610/hw_toc

         </pre>
         Notice that the extension \lq\lq .md\rq\rq\ is not included if the file
         is a Markdown file.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 6: Search the internet for sites that discuss absolute and
         relative errors. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that
         describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
    </li>
