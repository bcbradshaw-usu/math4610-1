  <ul>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 1: Set up an appointment to meet with your instructor via Zoom.
         There are a couple of ways to do this. During office hours you can join
         a Zoom meeting that will be running. The information, including a link
         and password will be sent to you via your email address. If you cannot
         make office hours, you can set up an appointment at another time to
         hold the meeting. To do this, (1) email your instructor with a time
         that will work, (2) copy the link in the return email into a browser,
         and (3) join the meeting on Zoom that has been set up.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 2: Email a link to your Github page. The links should be of the
         form
         <pre>

             https://username.github.io/

         </pre>
         where the "username" is the name you chose when setting up
         your account. Your instructor should be able to see your repositories 
         and any public files that are on the repository.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 3: In class we discussed the creation of a repository for your
         work in this course. This must be done as soon as possible during or
         just after the first lecture. Once you have created a private
         repository named
         <pre>

             math4610

         </pre>
         with a initial README.md file, do the following. Make sure that the
         repository is private and that the only other collaborator is the
         instructor for the class. The instructor email is contained in the
         syllabus for the course and can be accessed as follows.
         <pre>

             https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/syllabus/md/syllabus

         </pre>
         or
         <pre>

             https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/syllabus/pdf/syllabus.pdf

         </pre>
         Note, that inviting your instructor to be a collaborator will
         automatically be sent an email to respond to.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 4: Email your instructor as to which command line environment you
         will use in the course. Possible choices are: (1) term on Cygwin, (2)
         term or xterm on Linux, (3) the command window on MacOS, or (5)
         PowerShell on Windows. If you plan on emulating your instructor's
         terminal emulator, you should probably install Cygwin. However,
         installation of Cygwin is not required for the course.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 5: Email the instructor the link to the table of contents for your
         homework solutions. The link should be something like
         <pre>

             https://username.github.io/math4610/hw_toc

         </pre>
         Notice that the extension ".md" is not included if the file
         is a Markdown file. We will spend a bit of time on Markdown throughout
         the semester.
    </li>
    <hr>
    <li> Task 6: Search the internet for sites that talk about Version Control
         Systems (VCS) like Github. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences)
         that describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite in
         your response.
    </li>
