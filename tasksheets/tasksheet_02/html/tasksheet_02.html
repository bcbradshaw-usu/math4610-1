<h1>
  Math 4610 Fundamentals of Numerical Analysis: Tasksheet 2 Problems/Questions
</h1>

<hr>

The problems for the Tasksheet 02 are included below. The deadline for turning
in your work on these problems will be posted on the repository. In addition,
you will turn in your work through the math4610 repository. A directory will be
constructed that will be used as a place to store your work.

<h2> Tasks </h2>

<hr>

<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Task 1:</b> After deciding which programming language you will use,
        write a program that provides a response like that in the "Hello World!"
        output. Provide details of the compilation and execution of the code
        you write. Use a suitable response for the Python line "...it's only a
        <a href="../audio/mp11.wav"> bunny </a> ..."
  </li>

<hr>

  <li>
    <b>Task 2:</b> Edit the main README.md file in your Math 4610 repository
    on Github using your favorite browser. This means logging on to your
    Github account, navigating to the README.md file in the math4610
    repository, and editing the file on Github. In the README.md file,
    create an introduction that describes what the repository is being
    created for and put in a link to the table of contents for the homework
    problems and a link to the software manual you will create. Do this in
    Markdown - not html.
  </li>

<hr>

  <li>
  <b>Task 3:</b> Create the table of contents in a file with a name like
     <pre>

        toc/task_toc.md

     </pre>
     or something like this. After completing the tasks to this point, clone
     the repository to a local directory on a local computer using git. If you
     have already cloned the repository, use a
     <pre>

        koebbe% git pull

     </pre>
     command to pull the changes to your local copy of the repository..
  </li>

<hr>

  <li>
    <b>Task 4:</b> Now for something completely different - write out the
    analysis for the centered difference approximation in a Taylor series
    expansions. Show that the approximation is second order.
  </li>

<hr>

  <li>
    <b>Task 5:</b> Determine the order of accuracy of the central difference
    approximation of the second derivative. That is, analyze the approximation
    \[
      f''(x) \approx {{f(x+h) - 2 f(x) + f(x-h)}\over{h^2}}
    \]
    via Taylor series expansions. Write a code that approximates the second
    derivative of the function
    \[
         f(x) = cos(x)
    \] 
    at the point, \(x=2.0\). Use, \(h=1.0,0.5,0.1,0.01,0.001,\ldots,10^{-16}\).
    Create a table of
    difference values between the "exact" value of the second derivative.
  </li>

<hr>

  <li>
    <b>Task 6:</b> Search the internet for information regarding finite
    difference approximations of derivatives of different orders. Give
    examples of these types of approximations. You should be able to find
    many such examples. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that
    describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
  </li>

</ul>
